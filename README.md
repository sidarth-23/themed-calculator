## Introduction

I started of this project when I was learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JS. I wanted to implement the core functionalities of a web app in vanilla tech stack before diving deep into highly composed libraries like react where is core functionality is wrapped deep inside the core module that it is not visible to the average eye.
